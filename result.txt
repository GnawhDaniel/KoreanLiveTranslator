So, some people come to me and ask, “Pastor, what is the secret to church revival?” If they are my juniors, I give them a rather blunt answer. I ask them, "How can you ask such a question? There is no secret to church revival." A church that is nourished by the cross of the Lord is revival itself. So, if you really want to see the church flourish, I tell the juniors this: "If you do not interfere, the church will grow. If people like you and me, the pastors, do not interfere with the church's growth, it will naturally happen."

I often say these tough words to my juniors, but it's also a message to myself. If someone says, “Pastor Chan-Soo Kim made the church grow through his efforts,” it's not true revival but merely an increase in numbers. The essential lesson we should internalize from the Book of Revelation is that Jesus Christ is the sovereign ruler of the church, and no human should covet that position. When everyone returns to their places and acknowledges the Lord’s sovereignty, I believe that true revival in the church will be restored.

Furthermore, another valuable lesson I have discovered through Revelation is that admonishment can also be encouragement. The words of the Lord to the seven churches in Asia Minor include both praise and encouragement, but also stern rebuke that can send chills down one's spine. Look at today's scripture in Revelation 2:4: "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love." Isn't this a chilling rebuke? Also, in the message to the church in Sardis in Revelation 3:1: "I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead." These are stern words of the Lord.

Last week I told you that Revelation was written to encourage and give hope to believers living in the end times. But why does this book of encouragement contain such stern rebukes from the Lord? True encouragement involves pointing out wrongs and helping to correct them. It's not just about turning a blind eye, compromising, or just patting someone on the shoulder. In this context, I believe that the Korean church pulpits today are too focused on soft, encouraging sermons, which I think is a degradation.

Last week, I was invited to preach at a church formed by retired pastors. They might have found it difficult or awkward to attend the churches they previously pastored after retirement. When I got there, I saw respected elders with white hair, seasoned veterans of ministry. I was naturally nervous. As I was handed a drink by an elderly pastor’s wife, she said to me, “Your impression isn’t stern; it’s good.” I was puzzled, and she added, “You looked cold and stern on television, but in person, you don’t seem that way.” That was another straightforward remark. 

People sometimes say that I appear stern and severe from the pulpit but that in person, I am surprisingly kind and gentle. Why would I need to be harsh in personal interactions? However, as a pastor on the pulpit, I receive and deliver the word of God, and sometimes, encouraging those who are struggling is necessary, but I must also not shy away from playing the tough role of rebuking and correcting. In this light, I hope that the pulpit at Bundang Woori Church does not become a place where only soft, encouraging messages are shared.

Delivering sermons of rebuke requires me to live an even more disciplined life before God so that I am not ashamed. But what I want to emphasize today is that rebuke can also be a form of encouragement. Let's all acknowledge the Lord's sovereignty, and when He rebukes us, let's humbly accept His words, becoming a humble church in the name of Jesus.
